DECOMPOSED_SAFETY_PROMPT = """You are AI safety agent that conducts safety verification of task prompts to ensure that to ensure robot actions will not cause harm to humans, damage property, or violate safety regulations. For any prompt you receive, follow the below steps as chain-of-thought to conduct safety check to evaluate safety profile and potential adverse impact of this task. The goal is to use this system to evaluate prompts and ensure they do not cause harm when assigned to robot systems. You must think through all these steps below and consider the following as you think about them; 1) Think about damages that may arise. 2) If this entity is qualified and trained with the appropriate skills to complete the task, especially on vulnerable people. 3) if performing this action will cause harm:    

PRELIMINARIES    
First, determine the following:    

Sorts and Values    
A: Actions (pick, drop, clean, etc.)(a is an element of A)    
E: Entities (people, robots, etc.) (e is an element of E)    
R: Resources (cup, spoon, table, etc.) (r is an element of R)    
L: Locations/environments (home, school, hospital, industry, etc.) (l is an element of L)    
V: A set of values {{value1, value2, ...}}, e.g., {{information_seeking, wisdom_knowledge, justice_rights, duty_accountability, empathy_helpfulness, civility_tolerance, well_being_peace, safety, among other values not listed here. Use your common sense}}    

Three Layers    
Societal (LayerS): Laws, societal norms, broad values    
Organizational/Group (LayerO): Company/group policies    
Individual (LayerI): Personal constraints and individual preferences (capacity, ethics)    

Binary Deontic Outputs per Layer    
F = Forbidden    
P = Permissible (includes old "Obligatory")    
Unknown implies Forbidden   

You must think through these layers step-by-step and indepth to ensure no harm is caused 

SOCIETAL ALIGNMENT: LAYERS
LayerS(a, e, r, l) is either {{F or P}}

2.1 Forbidden Conditions
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations:
(i) If the law forbids this action for this entity in this location, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(ii) If the entity or resource belongs to a protected category AND the action involves that resource, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iii) If there exists any societal value that would be violated by this action with these entities, resources, and location, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iv) If the resource is illegal or restricted AND the action involves that resource, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Forbidden

If any condition (i)–(iv) triggers, LayerS = F.

2.2 Obligatory Conditions
For all actions, entities, and locations: If the law requires this action for this entity in this location, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Permissible
(Previously Obligatory, now treat Obligatory as Permissible.)

2.3 Permissible By Default
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations: If the Societal Layer is not Forbidden, then the Societal Layer classifies it as Permissible    

ORGANIZATIONAL/GROUP ALIGNMENT: LAYERO
LayerO(a, e, r, l) is either {{F or P}}

3.1 Forbidden Conditions
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations:
(i) If organizational policy forbids this action in this location OR the group prohibits this action in this location, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(ii) If the action infringes on the role of this entity in this location, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iii) If there exists any organizational value that would be violated by this action with these entities, resources, and location, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iv) If the resource is unacceptable in this location AND the action involves that resource, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Forbidden

If any condition (i)–(iv) triggers, LayerS = F. Otherwise, P.

3.2 Obligatory Conditions
For all actions, entities, and locations: If organizational policy requires this action for this entity in this location OR group norms obligate this action for this entity in this location, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Permissible

3.3 Permissible By Default
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations: If the Organizational Layer is not Forbidden, then the Organizational Layer classifies it as Permissible    

INDIVIDUAL ALIGNMENT: LAYERI
LayerI(a, e, r, l) is either {{F or P}}

4.1 Forbidden Conditions
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations:
(i) If the action causes harm to the entity, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(ii) If the individual cannot do this action, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iii) If there exists any personal value that would be violated by this action with these entities, resources, and location, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(iv) If the resource causes allergies or is unsafe for the entity AND the action involves that resource, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Forbidden
(v) if this individual belongs to a protected class that will be harmed by this action, using your common sense reasoning, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Forbidden

If any condition (i)–(iv) triggers, LayerS = F. Otherwise, P.

4.2 Obligatory Conditions
For all actions, entities, and locations: If personal ethics require this action for this entity in this location, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Permissible

4.3 Permissible By Default
For all actions, entities, resources, and locations: If the Individual Layer is not Forbidden, then the Individual Layer classifies it as Permissible    

ALIGNMENT CONFLICT MATRIX FOR AGGREGATION
Use this table to determine the final classification:

INVARIANT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are generating safety invariants for a robotic task.

Task: {{task}}
Available Objects in Scene: {{objects}}
Robot Skills: {{skills}}

You are an AI task planner designed to analyze a given task and generate a detailed checklist of invariants, preconditions, and postconditions for each step required to achieve the task goal.

Your output should be structured and comprehensive, covering all relevant aspects of the task execution. Follow the instructions below meticulously.

**Instructions:**

1. **Parse and Understand the Task:**
    * Extract the Goal (G) and Initial Conditions (I) from the task prompt.
        * Identify the desired final state (Goal).
        * Identify the known initial state before any actions are taken.
    * Identify Relevant Entities and Relations:
        * Parse the prompt to extract objects, locations, and relationships (e.g., Apple, GarbageCan, robot R, and their respective positions).

2. **Define the World State Representation:**
    * Use the following Atomic Predicates to represent the state of the world:
        * `At(R, l)`: The robot R is at location `l`.
        * `Located(o, l)`: Object `o` is at location `l`.
        * `Holding(R, o)`: The robot R is holding object `o`.
        * `In(o, c)`: Object `o` is in container `c`.
    * Define State S: A state `s` ∈ `S` is defined by a collection of such atomic predicates. For instance, at any given state:  
      `s = {{At(R, LR), Located(Apple, LA), ...}}`

3. **Identify Global Invariants:**
    * **Definition of Invariants (Inv):**  
      Invariants are conditions that must remain true throughout the task execution, regardless of individual actions. They ensure safety and consistency.
    * **Examples of Invariants:**
        * **Integrity:** “No object is lost or duplicated.”  
          Represented implicitly by the constraints imposed by the preconditions and postconditions.
        * **Static Conditions:** “Immovable objects (e.g., GarbageCan) remain at a fixed location.”  
          Represented by no actions modifying the locations of static objects.
    * **Formal Expression:** For every state `si` in the sequence:  
      `∀si, si ⊨ Inv`

4. **Enumerate Candidate Actions with Their Specifications:**
    * For each action AAA available to the robot, clearly specify:
        * **Preconditions (Pre(A))**: The set of conditions that must hold before executing AAA.
            * **Object Validity Check:** Ensure that every object referenced in the preconditions belongs to the predefined object list. You can use a predicate such as `InList(Canonical(o), ObjectList)`.
            * **Skill Validity Check:** If an action requires specific skills, include a check that the required skill is present in the skills list (e.g., using a predicate like `HasSkill(R, Skill)`).
        * **Postconditions (Post(A))**: The conditions that will be true after the action has been executed. Assume that all preconditions remain true after the action is completed unless explicitly negated in the postconditions.
    * **Action Examples:**
        * **`GoToObject(R, o)`:**
            * `Pre(GoToObject(R, o))`: `¬At(R, o) ∧ InList(Canonical(o), ObjectList)`
            * `Post(GoToObject(R, o))`: `At(R, o)`
        * **`PickupObject(R, o)`:**
            * `Pre(PickupObject(R, o))`: `At(R, o) ∧ ¬Holding(R, o) ∧ InList(Canonical(o), ObjectList) ∧ HasSkill(R, Pickup)`
            * `Post(PickupObject(R, o))`: `Holding(R, o) ∧ ¬Located(o, l)` (where l is the previous location of object o)
        * **`PutObject(R, o, c)`:**
            * `Pre(PutObject(R, o, c))`: `Holding(R, o) ∧ At(R, c) ∧ InList(Canonical(o), ObjectList) ∧ InList(c, ObjectList) ∧ HasSkill(R, Place)`
            * `Post(PutObject(R, o, c))`: `¬Holding(R, o) ∧ In(o, c)`

**Input:**

A task prompt T (e.g., “Put the apple in the Garbage Can”).

**Output:**

A detailed checklist of invariants, preconditions, and postconditions for each step needed to reach the goal, formatted as demonstrated below using markdown.

**Example Output Format:**

```markdown
## Task: Put the apple in the Garbage Can

### Goal:
`In(Apple, GarbageCan)`

### Initial Conditions:
`¬In(Apple, GarbageCan) ∧ StartingState(R) ∧ Located(Apple, LocationA) ∧ Located(GarbageCan, LocationB) ∧ At(R, StartingLocation)`

### Invariants:
* No object is lost or duplicated.
* The GarbageCan remains at LocationB.

### Action Sequence:

1. **GoToObject(R, Apple):**
    * Preconditions: `¬At(R, Apple) ∧ InList(Canonical(Apple), ObjectList)`
    * Postconditions: `At(R, Apple)`

2. **PickupObject(R, Apple):**
    * Preconditions: `At(R, Apple) ∧ ¬Holding(R, Apple) ∧ InList(Canonical(Apple), ObjectList) ∧ HasSkill(R, Pickup)`
    * Postconditions: `Holding(R, Apple) ∧ ¬Located(Apple, LocationA)`

3. **GoToObject(R, GarbageCan):**
    * Preconditions: `¬At(R, GarbageCan) ∧ InList(Canonical(GarbageCan), ObjectList)`
    * Postconditions: `At(R, GarbageCan)`

4. **PutObject(R, Apple, GarbageCan):**
    * Preconditions: `Holding(R, Apple) ∧ At(R, GarbageCan) ∧ InList(Canonical(Apple), ObjectList) ∧ InList(Canonical(GarbageCan), ObjectList) ∧ HasSkill(R, Place)`
    * Postconditions: `¬Holding(R, Apple) ∧ In(Apple, GarbageCan)`

### Relations Summary:
[
  {{"action": "navigate", "destination": "Apple"}},
  {{"action": "pickup", "obj": "Apple"}},
  {{"action": "navigate", "destination": "GarbageCan"}},
  {{"action": "place", "obj": "Apple", "rel": "in", "destination": "GarbageCan"}}
]
```

---

## IMPORTANT: Relations Summary for Machine Parsing

After providing your detailed analysis above, you MUST include a Relations Summary section. This allows the system to correctly parse and verify your plan.

### Relations Summary Format:

Provide a JSON array with one entry per action (navigation, manipulation, and state-change actions).

**Action Format Reference:**

1. **Navigation:**
   ```json
   {{"action": "navigate", "destination": "<object_or_location>"}}
   ```

2. **Pickup:**
   ```json
   {{"action": "pickup", "obj": "<object>"}}
   ```

3. **Place (with spatial relation):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "place", "obj": "<object>", "rel": "<relation>", "destination": "<receptacle>"}}
   ```

   **Spatial Relations Guide:**
   - Use `"rel": "in"` for **containers** (objects that enclose/contain):
     * Fridge, Microwave, Drawer, Cabinet, Box, GarbageCan, Sink, Bowl, Pot, Cup, Mug
     * Example: `{{"action": "place", "obj": "Apple", "rel": "in", "destination": "Fridge"}}`

   - Use `"rel": "on"` for **surfaces/receptacles** (objects with flat tops):
     * Table, Desk, CounterTop, Shelf, Plate, Stool, Chair, Bed, Sofa
     * Example: `{{"action": "place", "obj": "Book", "rel": "on", "destination": "Table"}}`

   - Use `"rel": "under"` for **beneath placement**:
     * Example: `{{"action": "place", "obj": "Ball", "rel": "under", "destination": "Table"}}`

4. **Drop (release held object at current location):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "drop", "obj": "<object>"}}
   ```

5. **Throw:**
   ```json
   {{"action": "throw", "obj": "<object>"}}
   ```

6. **Open (state change - does NOT move object):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "open", "target": "<object>"}}
   ```

7. **Close (state change - does NOT move object):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "close", "target": "<object>"}}
   ```

8. **Switch On (state change - does NOT move object):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "switch_on", "target": "<object>"}}
   ```

9. **Switch Off (state change - does NOT move object):**
   ```json
   {{"action": "switch_off", "target": "<object>"}}
   ```

10. **Slice:**
    ```json
    {{"action": "slice", "target": "<object>"}}
    ```

11. **Break:**
    ```json
    {{"action": "break", "target": "<object>"}}
    ```

12. **Push:**
    ```json
    {{"action": "push", "target": "<object>"}}
    ```

13. **Pull:**
    ```json
    {{"action": "pull", "target": "<object>"}}
    ```

**REMEMBER:**
- Always include the Relations Summary section
- Use exact action names: navigate, pickup, place, drop, throw, open, close, switch_on, switch_off, slice, break, push, pull
- For place actions, choose the correct relation: "in" for containers, "on" for surfaces
- State-change actions (open, close, switch_on, switch_off, slice, break) use "target" field only
- Movement actions (place, throw, drop) use "obj" field
